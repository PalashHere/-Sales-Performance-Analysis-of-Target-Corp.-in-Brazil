The first image shows a SQL query calculating the moving average of order values for each customer over their order history. This analysis helps in understanding customer spending patterns and how they evolve over time.
Top 5 Highest Revenue Generating Sellers:
The bar chart in Image 2 displays the top 5 sellers by revenue. The highest-grossing seller has generated significantly more revenue (around 500,000 units) compared to the others, which are clustered between 275,000 and 325,000 units.
SQL Query for Seller Revenue Ranking:
Image 3 contains a SQL query that calculates the total revenue generated by each seller and ranks them by revenue. This query likely produced the data for the bar chart in Image 2.
Order Count per Month in 2018:
The bar chart in Image 4 shows the number of orders per month in 2018. The data suggests a relatively stable order volume throughout the year, with slight variations. The highest order count appears to be in the earlier months (around 7,000 orders), with a slight decline towards the later months (around 6,500 orders).
